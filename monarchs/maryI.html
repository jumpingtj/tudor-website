        King Henry VIII
    </a> and his first wife Catherine of Aragon. Before Mary's birth, four previous pregnancies had resulted in a already dead daughter and three short-lived or already dead sons, including Henry ( Duke of Cornwall ). Mary was baptised into the Catholic
    faith at the Church of the Observant Friars in Greenwich three days after her birth. Her godparents included Lord Chancellor Thomas Wolsey, her great-aunt Catherine of York, Countess of Devon, and Agnes Howard, Duchess of Norfolk.
